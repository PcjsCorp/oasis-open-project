# Become an Ethereum OASIS Open Project Sponsor

Ethereum OASIS Open Project are supported by an international alliance of organizations committed to advancing the open source development of interoperability standards for the Ethereum community. New sponsors are welcome. 

The main reason to become a sponsor is to ensure your organization--and the world--can reap the benefits of high-quality specifications that facilitate Ethereumâ€™s longevity, interoperability, and ease of integration.

[Ethereum OASIS Open Project Sponsors](https://github.com/eea-oasis/managed-open-project/blob/master/SPONSORS.md) are recognized for their leadership in several ways.  

## Governance benefits
Each Sponsor organization has the option to hold a seat on the Ethereum OASIS Open Project Governing Board where they:
* Provide top-level guidance for the Ethereum OASIS Open Project community
* Influence the development of Ethereum OASIS Open Project standards, ensuring their organization's perspectives and use cases are represented
* Approve proposals for new work
* Approve all final specifications and other deliverables (one org/one vote)
* Decide which specifications to advance through the OASIS Open standards process
* Determine when approved work should be submitted to de jure standards bodies, e.g., ISO, IEC, ITU, UN/CEFACT
* Oversee the work of the Baseline Technical Steering Committee and other groups

## Visibility benefits
Sponsors receive exclusive visibility for their support. They:
* Stand out on the Ethereum OASIS Open Project GitHub site, the [Baseline website](http://baseline-protocol.org), and in social media
* Have their organizations named and their executive quotes featured in Ethereum OASIS Open Project press releases including Baseline press releases
* Provide testimonial quotes for the website
* Speak on behalf of Ethereum OASIS Open Project at conferences, workshops, and other events

## Sponsorship Levels
Each organization pays annual [Project Sponsorship dues](https://www.oasis-open.org/join-an-open-project/) based on its total employee headcount. Dues are administered by OASIS Open and used to provide core services including vendor-neutral governance, technical administration, IP management, collaboration tools, community support, and outreach.

We encourage all organizations that benefit from Ethereum OASIS Open Project standards to sponsor this important, nonprofit initiative. For information on becoming a Sponsor, [contact OASIS](mailto:communications@oasis-open.org).
