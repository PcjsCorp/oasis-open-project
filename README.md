# EEA Community Projects, an OASIS Managed Open Project

EEA Community Projects, an OASIS Managed Open Project, exists to provide a neutral forum for diverse stakeholders to create high-quality specifications that facilitate Ethereumâ€™s longevity, interoperability, and ease of integration. The EEA Community Projects intend to develop clear, open standards, high-quality documentation, and shared test suites that facilitate new features and enhancements to the Ethereum protocol.

For more information on the goals of this effort, see the [project charter](./PROJECT_CHARTER.md).

You can also sign up for [the EEA Community Projects email group](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/eea-community-projects) to receive occasional official notifications and discussions.
