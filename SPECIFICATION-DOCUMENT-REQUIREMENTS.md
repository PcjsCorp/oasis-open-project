# Ethereum OASIS Open Project


## Criteria for publishing specification documents

In addition to OASIS' basic criteria

### Release

* The document MUST clearly and accurately describe its current status, and the proposing group's *expectations* for its future (e.g. publishing schedule, final destiny, ...)
* The document MUST conform to [WCAG 2.1 level double-A](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#conformance)
* Links MUST NOT be broken on the date of publication
* The document MUST use IETF's [BCP14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14), i.e. [RFC2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html) and [RFC8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174.html) terminology for conformance
* If replacing an existing version of a *Project Specification*, there MUST be a changes section with human-readable explanation of changes made

The following requirements are optional at this stage but become mandatory at later stages:

* Each requirement in a spec SHOULD have a URL
* Each requirement SHOULD be testable.
* Specifications SHOULD describe security, privacy and internationalisation/localisation considerations. (For example, can human-readable text include language and direction information [see [string-meta](https://w3c.github.io/string-meta/)]? Is the protocol vulnerable to homoglyph attacks [see [CVE-2021-42574](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42574)]?)
* Any requirement obsoleted since a previous version of the *Project Specification* SHOULD have a URL that resolves to somewhere explicitly stating the requirement is gone
* Headings SHOULD have URLs that won't change, including fragment identifiers. (Including section numbers or similarly fragile details can make this more difficult.)
* There SHOULD be an implementation experience document which contains a complete list of requirements, and an explanation of how at least two implementations (and preferably more) have implemented and determined that their implementations meet each requirement.
